# fUML/PSCS Reference Implementation for C#
This software is an open source reference implementation of the *Semantics of a Foundational Subset for Executable UML Models* (fUML) and *Precise Semantics of UML Composite Structures* (PSCS)
specifications by the *Object Management Group* (OMG) (see [fUML](https://www.omg.org/spec/FUML/1.5/About-FUML) and [PSCS](https://www.omg.org/spec/PSCS/1.2/About-PSCS)). 
The fUML implementation of this software is based on the Java fUML reference implementation developed by
*Model Driven Solutions* (see [https://github.com/ModelDriven/fUML-Reference-Implementation](https://github.com/ModelDriven/fUML-Reference-Implementation))

## Licensing
For licensing information, please see the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/HammerMaximilian/fUML-CSharp/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Prerequisites
For detailed information, please see the [User Guide](fUML-C#_User_Guide.pdf) section *1. Prerequisites*.
### 1. Required Software
* *.NET Framework* (at least version 6.0)
* *Microsoft Visual Studio*[^1]
[^1]: For non-developing users Microsoft Visual Studio is only used for compilation. It is also possible to build C# projects from command line using *msbuild.exe* but for convenience it is suggested to use Microsoft Visual Studio.
### 2. Recommended but optional Software
* *Eclipse Modeling Tools* for creating UML models
  * *Java Runtime Environment* is required for Eclipse 
* *Eclipse Papyrus* for more sophisticated and graphical modeling of UML models
* *Acceleo* to be able to use the code generator for executable models

## Setup
For detailed information, please see the [User Guide](fUML-C#_User_Guide.pdf) section *2. Setup*.

## Building
For detailed information, please see the [User Guide](fUML-C#_User_Guide.pdf) section *3. Build*.

## Usage
For detailed information, please see the [User Guide](fUML-C#_User_Guide.pdf) section *4. Usage*.
### 1. Creating executable models using source code
### 2. Generating executable models from *.uml* models (*Acceleo* plugin for Eclipse has to be installed)
